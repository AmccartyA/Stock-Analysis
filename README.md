# Stock-Analysis
This Project will Analyze stock to better predict Future Outcomes
## Overview of Project
Using Macros, This excel spreadsheet can now process Thousands of lines of Stock data and give a comprehensive coverage of  current trends of multiple Stock Indexes
 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 While refactoring the original code, I ran into a couple of errors when exchanging information between the arrays. It required reaching out to a Teacher assist to help figure out that I needed to close the If statement first. After I found my error, I was happy with how much cleaner and easier to read my code was.
 
 The disadvantage of refactoring code as the original code worked fine before I tried to condense it. Causing me to have to spend extra time and energy to fix something that wasn't originally broken.
 
## Results
From the Data in the VBA Challenge sheet. You can see that while most stocks performed well in 2017, only ENPH and RUN performed well in both 2017 and 2018. Using this data we could invest into either company with hopes of making a profit in 2019 and beyond
